## MLOps Observability Platform

**A production-grade platform for monitoring, validating, and maintaining ML models in real-world environments.**

### 🚀 Project Overview

This project implements a modular, scalable MLOps observability platform designed for real-time model monitoring, data validation, and automated feedback loops. It's engineered to meet the needs of modern AI teams operating at scale.

### 🏗️ Architecture

- **API Layer:** FastAPI for model serving and monitoring endpoints
- **Validation Layer:** Automated schema and data drift checks
- **Monitoring Layer:** Prometheus for metrics collection
- **Model Registry:** MLflow for versioning and metadata
- **Visualization:** Grafana dashboards for real-time insights

### Model Registry

The Model Registry component provides a centralized repository for model versioning, metadata tracking, and lifecycle management. Key features include:

- Model versioning and storage
- Model metadata and lineage tracking
- Performance metrics comparison between versions
- Stage transitions (development → staging → production)
- Integration with monitoring systems for observability

#### Usage Example

```python
from src.model_registry.client import ModelRegistry
from src.model_registry.version import compare_model_versions

# Initialize registry client
registry = ModelRegistry(tracking_uri="http://mlflow-server:5000")

# Register a new model
model_uri = registry.register_model(
    model_path="s3://models/model.pkl",
    name="fraud_detection",
    tags={"algorithm": "xgboost", "owner": "data-science-team"}
)

# Compare different model versions
comparison = compare_model_versions(
    registry,
    model_name="fraud_detection",
    version1="1",
    version2="2",
    metric="auc"
)
```

### 📝 Technical Details - API Implementation

The API implementation follows industry best practices:

1. **Monitoring Integration**:
   - Decorator-based metrics collection
   - Non-intrusive monitoring
   - Maintainable metric system

2. **Validation Pipeline**:
   - Early data rejection
   - Bad data tracking
   - Drift detection

3. **Documentation**:
   - Swagger UI integration
   - Auto-generated documentation
   - Interactive API testing

This architecture ensures robust monitoring while maintaining clean, maintainable code.
